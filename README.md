# Description:

This is a simple React project CRUD application as an exercise.

As a challenge I chose to use Typescript as the language of choice.

To run localy simply clone this repo and run `yarn` then `yarn dev` on terminal to start locally. Make sure rocketseat-fullstack-final-api is up annd running correctly first.

# Deploy

This project is hosted on netlify.com. The domain is at `https://foodexplorer-final.netlify.app` and makes requests to my node express backend API hosted at render.com (`https://rocketseat-fullstack-final-api.onrender.com`)

# Issues

- Couldn't figure out how to implement responsive design (It is a mobile first front-end application)
